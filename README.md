## Migrating VSCode settings to VSCodium

### <a id="manual-migration"></a>Manual Migration from Visual Studio Code to VSCodium

VSCodium (and a freshly cloned copy of vscode built from source) stores its extension files in `~/.vscode-oss`. So if you currently have Visual Studio Code installed, your extensions won't automatically populate. You can copy the `extensions` from `~/.vscode/extensions` to `~/.vscode-oss/extensions`.

Visual Studio Code stores its `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` file in these locations:

- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\Code\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/Code/User`

You can copy these files to the VSCodium user settings folder:

- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\VSCodium\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/VSCodium/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/VSCodium/User`

To copy your settings manually:

- In Visual Studio Code, go to Settings (`Meta+,`)
- Click the three dots `...` and choose 'Open settings.json'
- Copy the contents of settings.json into the same place in VSCodium
